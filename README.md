Data is a sequence of characters or symbols that are stored and processed for analysis purposes. The computer data is also a stream of bits (0s and 1s) that are stored in the computer memory for further processing or translation.

These bits can be information in the form of text docs, images, videos, or some other type of data. This data is in a form that is perfect for movement and processing.

This data processing is done by the CPU(Central Processing Unit) and stored in the computerâ€™s memory. Therefore, the data in the computer can be created, processed, and stored.


## Types of Data

**The data in computers can be categorized into three types-**

* Data at rest 
* Data in transit
* And, the data in use
